# E-Commerce Application - Onion Architecture with CQRS and Mediator Design Patterns

This is an E-Commerce application developed using the Onion architecture, with a strong emphasis on the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Mediator design patterns.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a scalable and maintainable solution for building an E-Commerce platform. The application architecture follows the Onion architecture pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and modular development. The CQRS pattern is employed to segregate read and write operations, allowing for better performance, scalability, and maintainability. The Mediator design pattern acts as a communication hub between application components, providing a decoupled and extensible approach.

## Key Features

**Onion Architecture:** The project adheres to the principles of the Onion architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and promoting maintainability and testability.
**CQRS Pattern:** The CQRS pattern is utilized to separate read and write operations, optimizing performance and scalability. It enables the application to handle complex queries and provides a more flexible architecture for future enhancements.
**Mediator Design Pattern:** The Mediator pattern acts as a central communication channel between application components. It promotes loose coupling and simplifies the addition of new features by encapsulating communication logic within the Mediator.
